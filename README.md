This is a beaches website where i used React with Vite and Tailwind css and it's not a functional website,just a template. I do this project to upgrade my Tailwind css 
skills after doing that I achieve some knowledge that's are like..

1. Responsive Navigation menu bar with hamburger icon.
2. Custom design with tailwind css.
3. Custom Carousel design with functionality.
4. Grid system and Responsive Footer and many more.
